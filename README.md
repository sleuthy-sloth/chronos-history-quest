# Chronos - History Quest 🏛️

> "I found Rome a city of bricks and left it a city of marble."

**Chronos** is a gamified, narrative-driven history learning platform. It reimagines education by combining the addictive mechanics of modern language apps with the depth of "Hardcore History" storytelling and a tactical, immersive UI.

## 🌟 Mission Profile

Chronos is designed to make history active, not passive. Users don't just read dates; they make decisions as Roman Consuls, decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs, and trace the trade routes of the Persian Empire.

### Core Features

*   **Tactical Interface**: A mature, polished UI inspired by military dossiers and museum archives, moving away from childish cartoons.
*   **4 Great Civilizations**: Rome, Egypt, Byzantium, and Persia.
*   **AI-Powered Curriculum**: Google Gemini 2.5 dynamically generates lesson content on the fly, filling in a 100+ lesson skeleton structure with period-accurate narratives and quizzes.
*   **Interactive Activities**:
    *   **Decision**: Roleplay key historical moments (e.g., "Do you cross the Rubicon?").
    *   **Map Conquest**: Interactive geography challenges.
    *   **Sorting**: Chronological ordering of events.
    *   **Decipher**: Translate ancient scripts.
*   **Live Tutor**: Real-time voice conversation with "Chronos" (AI Tutor) using the Gemini Live API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, TypeScript
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (Custom "Tactical" Design System)
*   **AI**: Google GenAI SDK (`@google/genai`)
*   **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore)
*   **Visuals**: Pollinations.ai (Dynamic AI Imagery), Wikimedia Commons (Historical Artifacts)
